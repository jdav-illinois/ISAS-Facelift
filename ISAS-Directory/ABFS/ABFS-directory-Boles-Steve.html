<h4>General Interests</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>My general focus and expertise is in lithic studies spanning Midwestern prehistory, Plains Paleo, and public outreach. Outreach is heavily aimed at avocational groups, recording private collections, distributing educational material, giving presentations, and providing instruction and assistance in caring for cultural resources and material. I&rsquo;m also interested in Mississippian iconography, geophysical survey, and material culture in general and how these avenues of research can offer insights into community organization and identity.</p>
</div>
<h4>Current Projects and Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Supervised analysis of lithic material recovered by the Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) between 2008 and 2012 from the East Saint Louis Mound Complex. Analysis recently completed and currently writing a lithics chapter for a summary volume and a data based lithics volume.</p>
    <p>Finalizing work on an Illinois Point and Chert Guide to be published by ISAS in 2015. Writing responsibilities included numerous projectile point narratives, and various cultural aspects and life ways presented in sidebars.</p>
    <p>Conducting analyses for publication of ceramic, lithic, and faunal material recovered from surface collections from the Linn-Heilig site in Union County, Illinois and the Orr-Herl site in Hardin County, Illinois.</p>
