<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Laura has served as ISAS curator since 2002. She has overseen the greatly increased pace of incoming archaeological collections, mostly from the 600&ndash;800 boxes of newly excavated artifacts each year. Notably, 550 boxes were accessioned in 2003 from the Department of Anthropology, and 1,500 boxes were accessioned in 2005. She serves on the <a href="http://will.illinois.edu/pwg" title="U of I Preservation Working Group" target="_blank">University of Illinois Preservation Working Group</a>, which performed a survey on campus-wide collection needs. Her duties include grant writing and policy writing and implementation. In 2010, about 6,000 boxes were moved out of the campus warehouse into climate-controlled space.</p>
    <p>During her work for the Corps of Engineers, she assessed over 60 curation facilities nationwide. Kozuch’s research focus is faunal analysis and in particular the manufacture, use, and trade of animal bones and shells. She was based at the Florida Museum of Natural History for 12 years, performing faunal analyses and curation of artifacts and faunal specimens. She has identified remains from a wide range of sites in the Southeast and Caribbean, and wrote a monograph on shark utilization, as well as a guide to identifying shark vertebrae. Her life-long interest is the marine shell trade in North America. Currently, she is replicating beads from the columellae of lightning whelk (<em>Busycon sinistrum</em>) shells. The correct identification of traded animal remains is essential to understand sourcing and movement of trade goods.</p>
