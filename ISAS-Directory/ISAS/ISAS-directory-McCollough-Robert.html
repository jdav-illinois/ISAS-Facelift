<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Dr McCullough’s research interests include the archaeology of the eastern woodlands, especially the population movements and interactions of Late Prehistoric and Mississippian groups in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley states, as well as late-contact/fur trade era sites in Indiana, prehistoric ceramic analysis, and cultural resource management. He directed 10 field seasons of excavations in Hamilton County, Indiana, where three different Late Prehistoric populations living at the extremes of their traditional homelands each built a palisaded village within view of the others.</p>
    <p>Dr. McCullough also has been active in the application of geophysical survey techniques to archaeological sites. Awarded a National Science Foundation grants for instrumentation and then research experience for undergraduates, he taught geophysical survey methods for three summers and has continued archaeological geophysical methods in such varied projects as identification of subsurface features at the Mount Pleasant Indian Industrial Boarding School for the Saginaw Band of Chippewa, survey at the Levi Coffin underground railroad site in Indiana, and the identification of a Native American encampment outside 18th-century Fort Ouiatenon on the Wabash River.</p>
