<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Thomas Loebel specializes in the archaeology of the Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene period of North America, with particular emphasis on the Midwest and western Great Lakes regions, although he has worked at sites or analyzed materials from various sites across the US. His technical specialties include the Organization of Lithic Technology, High-Power Microwear Analysis, Experimental Archaeology, Geophysical Survey, Cultural Resource Management, Underwater Archaeology, and Public Archaeology, Outreach and Education.</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p><strong>Illinois and Wisconsin Fluted Point Survey</strong><br>This ongoing project to record fluted points (Clovis/Gainey and Folsom) in private and public collections is aimed at building a regional framework of site location, lithic raw material procurement, and land use patterns to examine large-scale patterns of social and economic adaptation. This project relies heavily on a collaborative approach with professional colleagues and the private community.

    <p><strong>Carlisle Clovis Cache</strong><br>Excavated from primary context in 1968, the Carlisle Cache represents one of only several contextually intact Clovis components in the Midcontinent. The cache is collection of utilitarian gear, including 25 bifaces and 12 large flakes made on Burlington chert, that was stockpiled to back future hunting, butchering, and hide processing activities in the central Des Moines River Valley. Though it was designed to satisfy the anticipated, task-specific needs of both men and women, the raison d'&ecirc;tre for the cache’s contents was not executed. In preparing for extended forays away from prime tool stone sources, greater emphasis was placed on gearing up weaponry components than on butchery and hide-processing tools, in anticipation of a relatively higher rate of point turn-over due to damage or loss in hunting. While the bifaces could have served as a source of small flakes for expedient tools, they are far too small to have served efficiently as bifacial cores. Instead, bifaces and large flake-blanks were made from tabular cores at the tool stone source, with intentions of future conversion into weapon tips and a multitude of unifacial tools, respectively. This two-fold system of biface and flake production enabled Clovis foragers to prosper off-quarry no matter whether spoor steered them into mapped or unmapped areas. Technological and subsistence confidence was managed by performing early interval biface work at quarry sources, thereby decreasing the chances of off-quarry, late interval (point) manufacturing failures, and by regularly carrying substantial numbers of point and unifacial tool preforms. Such items were occasionally cached in areas where tool kits were prone to rapid depletion based on a history there of kill-butchery events, as well as at previously unvisited locations judged to have good potential for similar activities during anticipated future movements.</p>
    <p><strong>Endscraper microwear studies</strong><br>This project combines the experimental replication and use of endscrapers to examine the function of these items within the early Paleoindian toolkit. Long argued to be either hide, wood, or bone working implements, the combined experimental program and examination of over 200 endscrapers from six major early Paleoindian sites (Hawk’s Nest, Mueller-Keck, Gainey, Nobles Pond, Shawnee-Minisink, and Shoop) across the eastern Woodlands is the first large scale functional study of this ubiquitous tool class, and indicates their primary function is the processing of fresh hide.</p>
    <p><strong>DeWulf site</strong><br>Early Holocene (circa 8&ndash;10,000 B.P) archaeological sites associated with the Late Paleoindian occupation of the Midcontinent are rare, generally consisting of isolated lanceolate projectile points suggestive of hunting losses or scatters of stone tools and related manufacture and maintenance debris, perhaps representative of short term habitation sites. The DeWulf site, near Colona, in Henry County, does not fit comfortably into either of these general site-type categories. The collection of material from the site totals nearly 5,000 specimens, including bifaces, projectile points, and large flakes, all of which are fragmentary and, oddly, burned as well. In our view, ritual activity whereby artifacts were intentionally destroyed and ritually disposed of accounts for this interesting pattern, as opposed to the possible combined effects of agricultural damage and natural fires. All things considered, the activities recorded at DeWulf fall comfortably into what is currently informally known as the Renier Ceremonial Complex (RCC). As one of only a handful of RCC sites reported to date, DeWulf offers important new evidence on Late Paleoindian social relations and ritual practices in the region.</p>
