<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Midwestern Archaeology; French Colonial and European-American settlement of Illinois; Late Woodland Upland Settlements; Terminal Late Woodland culture, Mississippian formation. During my time at ISAS I have had the good fortune of working throughout the state on an assortment of prehistoric and historic period sites. Prehistoric sites range from small ephemeral Archaic period occupations all the way to excavations at the massive East St. Louis Mound Complex. Historic sites include everything from eighteenth century French colonial settlements to the investigation late nineteenth and early twentieth century East St. Louis neighborhoods. Although I have a general interest in all aspects of Illinois archaeology, my main area of emphasis is on Illinois History. I would like to continue research and writing in regards to French Cahokia, but welcome the opportunity to examine a seldom-explored industrial center.</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Following the conclusion of Mississippi River Bridge Project fieldwork in East St. Louis, I began the initiation of an inventory and analysis for all historic materials collected during the project. This includes artifacts collected from ca. 1865-1920s features at more than a half dozen sites in East St. Louis. The goals of the inventory are to establish the quantity, quality and context of all collected artifacts while developing research goals for the final report. Preliminary questions are focused on the quality of life for the working class in a turn of the century industrial center. I also have the goal of analyzing and reporting investigations within Lot 23 of 11S1802 in French Cahokia. During this small project the potential remains of the poteaux-sur-sole home of Francois Trotier were located.</p>
