<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Duane joined Special Projects at ISAS in 2013. His research interests are focused on the archaeology of eastern North America, especially Illinois.</p>
    <p>Concentrating on the archaeology of the Central Illinois River Valley and western Illinois, Duane spent over 25 years at Western Illinois University and the Dickson Mounds branch of the Illinois State Museum before pursuing his PhD at University of North Carolina&ndash; Chapel Hill. Duane&rsquo;s research interests have focused on Archaic through Colonial periods, with special attention to Colonial period, protohistoric, and post-800 A.D. prehistoric topics.</p>
</div>
<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Duane&rsquo;s most recent Illinois research integrates cartographic, ethnographic, linguistic and historical evidence to provide a new and unified resolution of the 300-year-old mystery of the iconological and mythological significance of the Alton, Illinois &ldquo;Piasa&rdquo; account first recorded by Father Jacques Marquette in 1673.</p>
    <p>His recently completed dissertation at University of North Carolina (entitled &ldquo;<em>Another Kind of Beads: A Forgotten Industry of the American Colonial Period&rdquo;</em>) provides the first definition and analysis of a standardized marine shell ornament industry that originated at the very beginning of the Northeast&rsquo;s Dutch Colonial period.</p>
