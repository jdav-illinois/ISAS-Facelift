<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Mary Simon conducts general studies in paleoethnobotanty of the Midwest, with focus on sites from Illinois. She oversees an active research lab with several workers and offers a summer intern program for graduate students interested in learning the basics of archaeobotanical materials identification and reporting.</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Currently conducting a review and synthesis of Archaic Period paleoethnobotanical studies in the Midwest with focus on inter-regional variability and agricultural origins.</p>
    <p>Conducting ongoing analysis of structural wood charcoal from burned buildings, particularly those from the Mississippian Period East St. Louis site in the American Bottom of Illinois. These studies are aimed at assessing variability in wood use among prehistoric peoples as it reflects social structure as well as functionality.</p>
    <p>Ongoing research is focusing on Late Woodland and Mississippian patterns of plant use in northern Illinois. These studies are particularly interested in assessing the role of cultigens among these groups.</p>

<h4>Selected Bibliography</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Over the past 15 years, Mary Simon has completed chapters summarizing the archaeobotanical remains from many sites located across Illinois. These chapters are published in the Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research Reports Series, the Transportation Archaeological Research Report Series, and the FAI-270 Site Reports Volumes Series. She has also prepared short reports found in CRM compliance reports submitted to IDOT. Inquiries are welcome and she will make these available if requested.</p>
