<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Thomas Emerson is a specialist in North American Eastern Woodlands archaeology, especially of the Upper Mississippi River Valley region. His research has generally centered on the archaeology, religious ideology, and political economy of late prehistoric Mississippian cultures. However, his interests are diverse and his work has included mortuary analyses, subsistence studies, archaeological ethnicity, archaeometric sourcing of raw materials, faunal analysis, Great Lakes maritime research, archaeological law and compliance, heritage management, and cultural resource management. He has conducted fieldwork throughout the Great Lakes region, the Plains (Missouri Trench), and Norway.</p>
    <p>Emerson is dedicated to the publication of archeological materials and in this role has founded nine publication series, most recently, Issues in Eastern Woodlands Archaeology with Timothy Pauketat for AltaMira Press. He has served as editor for South Dakota Archeology and Illinois Archaeology and book review editor for Illinois Archaeology. His professional services have included activities/memberships with such groups as the National Association of State Archaeologists; Committee on Public Archaeology, Society for American Archaeology; the Illinois Interagency Coal Mining Committee; Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials Steering Committee, Midcontinental Archaeometry Working Group, UIUC; RPA Recruitment Committee; and the SAA Cultural Resource Management Award Committee. He was also the primary author of Illinois&rsquo; major archaeological laws, Archaeological and Paleontological Resources Protection Act (20 ILCS 3435) and the Human Skeletal Remains Protection Act (20 ILCS 3440), as well as portions of the Illinois State Agency Historic Resources Preservation Act (20 ILCS 3420).</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Pipestone Sourcing Project. Joint project with Randall Hughes, Illinois State Geological Survey and Sarah Wisseman, Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Materials Program, to identify the pipestone sources used for Cahokia-style figurines and Hopewell effigy and plain platform pipes. Currently developing PIMA technology to source artifacts throughout the North American midcontinent. The latest NSF grant has expanded our research to consider Middle Woodland uses of catlinite and Illinois and Ohio pipestone.</p>
    <p>Upper Mississippian Tribalization Project. This research focuses on diet, health, and mortuary practice of Upper Mississippian populations in the Midwest and the impact of the Cahokian political, religious, and cultural florescence on these populations. It involves analysis of physical attributes of populations including isotopic and C14 data and a reanalysis of earlier cultural and mortuary evidence collected by UIUC investigators.</p>
    <p>Cahokian Collapse Project. Project began in 1993 and involves the detailed re-examination of the physical anthropology, isotope analysis, C14 dating, and cultural history of the Moorehead&ndash;Sand Prairie transition to address the timing and conditions preceding the collapse of the Cahokian polity.</p>
