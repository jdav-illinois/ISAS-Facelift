<hr>
<p>Alleen Betzenhauser served as a crew member, crew chief, and research assistant through the Central Office and the American Bottom Survey Division for nine years before she became a Research Archaeologist and Site Supervisor at the East St. Louis Mound Complex. She has had the opportunity to excavate and supervise Phase II and Phase III investigations at several Late Woodland and Mississippian period sites located throughout the American Bottom region.</p>
<p>Her interest in archaeology began as an undergraduate student at Boston University where she focused on Mayan Archaeology. While there, she developed a strong interest in the complex societies of the New World. After learning about the great Native American metropolis of Cahokia during her senior year, she decided to shift focus to Mississippian archaeology in Illinois. She moved to Champaign to pursue her PhD in Anthropology at the University of Illinois under the guidance of Dr. Timothy Pauketat.</p>
<p>Alleen completed her dissertation titled, &ldquo;Creating the Cahokian Community: The Power of Place in Early Mississippian Sociopolitical Dynamics,&rdquo; in 2011. She incorporated geophysical survey, GIS, excavation, and ceramic and lithic analysis to address how local groups within the American Bottom region negotiated and helped contribute to the construction of the Cahokian community and polity at the beginning of the Mississippian period (ca. A.D. 1050).</p>
<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Alleen&rsquo;s interests broadly construed include the archaeology of complex societies in the New World, community construction, and issues of pre-Columbian urbanism and rurality. Methodologically she is interested in the incorporation of geophysical prospection and GIS in archaeological research and Mississippian and Late Woodland ceramic analysis.</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Alleen maintains a strong interest in the transitional Terminal Late Woodland&ndash;Mississippian period in the American Bottom region as reflected in and mediated by changes in materiality, architecture, and the construction of communities and space. Currently she is directing the analysis of Terminal Late Woodland and Mississippian ceramic materials recovered over the last four years from the East St. Louis Mound Complex. She recently completed several short reports and a more extensive research report concerning ISAS investigations at several Late Woodland and Mississippian period sites in the American Bottom region and southern Illinois.</p>
