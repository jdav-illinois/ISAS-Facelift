<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Brian Adams received a PhD from the Anthropology Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His dissertation focused on the Middle to Early Upper Palaeolithic transition in Central Europe and included analyses of settlement patterns, lithic raw material use, and lithic tool utilization based on high-power microwear analysis. He supervised excavations at Early Upper Palaeolithic sites in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt, and assisted with the analysis of lithic artifacts from these sites. At the same time, he gained practical experience in cultural resource management in the Midwest, conducting Phase I, II and III investigations at prehistoric and historic sites. His technical skills include lithic analysis and high-power microwear analysis. In addition, he is interested in historic preservation, and has participated in several efforts to landmark historic structures.</p>
