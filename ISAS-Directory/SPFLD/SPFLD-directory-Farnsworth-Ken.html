<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Ken Farnsworth specializes in the archaeology of the Eastern Woodlands, with a study emphasis on the Great Lakes-Riverine area of the northeastern U.S. His research is principally focused on studies of subsistence and trade in late prehistoric times (the end of the Archaic period to the end of the Woodland period), using excavated data collected at sites in western Illinois and the adjacent Mississippi Valley. A continuing theme of his research efforts has been the detailed study of changing Woodland ceramic styles and sherd assemblages to help develop fine-grained cultural chronologies and identify regional social boundaries.</p>
    <p>He is also dedicated to the publication of archaeological information and ideas, and has edited two fieldwork-focused publication series (Center for American Archeology Reports of Investigations and Technical Reports) and three overview archaeology volumes: <em>Early Woodland Archeology</em>&nbsp;(1986), <em>Now Quite Out of Society</em>&nbsp;(2002), and&nbsp;<em>Early Hopewell Mound Explorations</em> (2004). He serves as Senior Research Editor at ISAS, where he is currently assembling <em>Illinois Hopewell</em> and <em>Late Woodland Mounds. The Excavations of Gregory Perino: 1950&ndash;1975</em>.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, Farnsworth has developed a research interest in historical-site documentation and interpretation, with a study emphasis on Pioneer to Civil War-period early industrial, commercial, manufacturing, and military sites.</p>

<h4>Current Research</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p><strong>Origins of Hopewellian Ritual.</strong>&nbsp;Study [with Karen Atwell] of the development of Illinois Hopewellian mortuary ritual as viewed from two two recently excavated lower IL Valley mound sites (Naples-Russell and Blue Island) and as compared to early central IL Valley Hopewellian mortuary sites (Neteler, Ogden-Fettie, and Liverpool).</p>
    <p><strong>Non-Riverine Pathways of Communication and Trade.</strong>&nbsp;Study [with Robert Mazrim] of the prehistoric time depth of travel, settlement, and trade along the historically documented overland route of Edwards Trace in upland west-central Illinois.</p>
    <p><strong>The End of Hopewell.</strong> Regional Study&nbsp;[with Andrew Fortier] of lower IL Valley habitation sites and mounds dating to the end of Hopewell and the beginning of Late Woodland times. This study of dramatic culture change at the interface between Havana and Weaver phases is anchored by analysis of habitation remains recovered by recent ITARP excavations at the Egan site.</p>
    <p><strong>Development of Late Woodland Mortuary Ritual.</strong>&nbsp;Analysis [with Karen Atwell and Paula Cross] of associated Weaver-era mortuary and habitation remains at the Friendly Neighbor site in the interior uplands between the lower IL Valley and adjacent Mississippi Valley.</p>
    <p><strong>Terminal Archaic Mortuary Ritual in the Upper Mississippi Valley.</strong>&nbsp;Analysis of salvage excavations at the Bunker Hill site -- a &ldquo;Red Ochre&rdquo; complex mortuary site in the west-central IL interior uplands. The Bunker Hill burial data and artifact styles are compared with remains previously found at contemporary mortuary sites throughout the Great Lakes-Riverine area to regionally evaluate Terminal Archaic mortuary ritual and related exchange.</p>
