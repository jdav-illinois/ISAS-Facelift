<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Clare&rsquo;s career as an archeologist began in England. She has worked on Middle and Upper Palaeolithic sites in France, on Romano-British, Anglo-Saxon and Mediaeval sites in England and on everything from Palaeoindian to Industrial sites in the US. The majority of her field experience has been in the Midwest. Her particular areas of expertise are faunal analysis, and historic archaeology. Clare&rsquo;s interests lie in subsistence and landscape use, particularly how prehistoric people adapted to changes in their environment and how historic landscape organization changed over time.</p>
