<h4>ATAM Research</h4>
<p>The Illinois State Archaeological Survey (ISAS) curates a variety of archaeological materials from across the state. Recent special projects include multidisciplinary analysis of prehistoric dog remains (Dr. Joseph Galloy), mastadon teeth (Steve Kuehn), canine coprolites (Dr. Andrew Fortier), and ancient uncarbonized squash seeds (Mary Simon). These materials are studied to better understand paleoecology of the state as well as plant and animal domestication in later prehistory. <a href="https://www.isas.illinois.edu/cms/One.aspx?portalId=260711&amp;pageId=269674" title="ATAM Research"><strong>Click here</strong></a> to read more about ATAM research.</p>
