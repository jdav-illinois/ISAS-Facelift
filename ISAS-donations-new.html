    <h3>Current Fundraising Priorities</h3>
    <p>Right now, your gift helps fund our priority research projects: the Cahokia Research Initiative and Archaeology at Allerton.</p>

    <h4>Cahokia Research Initiative</h4>
    <p>For nearly a century the University of Illinois has been researching Cahokia, a thousand-year-old urban center on the Mississippi that, archaeologists and Native descendants believe, dramatically affected the social history of North America, even into the colonial American era. </p>

    <h4>Archaeology at Allerton</h4>
    <p>In 2017, the Central Illinois Field Station assisted with geophysical investigations at Samuel’s Mounds in Allerton Park and Retreat Center and also helped run the Parkland College archaeological field school at that site. We hope to continue this valuable collaboration. </p>
