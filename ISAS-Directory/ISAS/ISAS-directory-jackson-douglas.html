<h4>General Interest/Area of Focus</h4>
<div class="has-margins">
    <p>Doug Jackson’s archaeological career at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has focused on Cultural Resource Management investigations. He has participated in and has been the field director of numerous site/project investigations over a 25+ year period. Most of these projects have been located in and around the American Bottom region of southwestern Illinois (Madison, St. Clair, and Monroe counties). Cultural components ranging from throughout the prehistoric and early historic eras were encountered on these projects, but most of the components Jackson has been involved with fall into the late prehistoric era (Late Woodland through Mississippian periods). His primary interest in these periods is ceramic analysis and documenting ceramic change through time. Jackson’s most recent field investigations were situated in the south suburban Chicago area, where extensive excavations were undertaken at the important Upper Mississippian period Hoxie Farm site. Jackson has been active in the East Central Illinois Archaeological Society, a local avocational group, and he serves as professional advisor to this organization.</p>
